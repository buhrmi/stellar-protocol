## Simple Summary
Remove the `createAccount` transaction, and trustlines to make Steller more accessible to new users.

## Motivation
The current solution to depositing an asset in a new users account is as follows

Create a stellar account in their wallet
Somehow acquire lumens to fund and open the account
Open a trustline for the asset
Provider sends payment
This has a few points of failure, and the burden of asking clients to acquire lumens is too high.

## Abstract
The proposed solution is to completely remove the `createAccount` transaction and trustlines.
Any account will be able to hold and unlimited number of assets issued by somebody else, without first creating a trustline.
